In my game the UI is integrated into the game so there is only one real module: the game itself. Each level is represented by a list of strings which construct the layout of the game by the characters in the string. This includes information about what enemies to place what blocks to place and where the player spawns and must exit. The middle section of the code is a bunch of classes of the game objects created in the levels. Right under the levels there is a function that builds the level each time the game progresses as well as a class dedicated to color. Underneath all of the game object classes is the game class/ this is where the run function is located and where the game is structured and played.

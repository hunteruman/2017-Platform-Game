This is fundamentally a videogame and can run on any computer that has python and pygame installed. The user must install the correct version of pygame from this link http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml and once that is done, from the command prompt, all the user has to do is type in the location of the 'gon.py' file and the game will run. Alternatively, if python and pygame are installed on the user's computer and the user has an IDE that can open and run the gon.py script, the user can run it and play from the IDE.
